0,MegaNative,Fishman Healthcare,4/5 stars,"June 17, 2021",It is simple to create an app. Their response is also good. They delivered the app on time. Happy to associate with MageNative. 
1,MegaNative,Magroceries,5/5 stars,"June 16, 2021","I have tried out 10+ different apps and none of them were able to help me they way this one did. Through the great help from the developers I was able to customise a currency conversion option that is essential to my business. When there is a problem, customer support will have it fixed for you before you even know it. This is app you want to use if you want your own shopping app! Also, it is far cheaper that most others and gives much more value that the once that are able to offer an even lower price. This the the best cost/benefit you will find! "
2,MegaNative,The Magic Box Boutique,1/5 stars,"June 14, 2021","If I could give 0 stars I would! I was unable to use this app and paid for a 6 months subscription apparently my business isn't allowed to be in the IOS or Android platforms, after informing the company their solution was for me to add these long instructions on my website for customers to download the app. Literally the steps we have to take to get the app on our phones as if any customer would take that much time out of their day to add an app. After a month of waiting for a response refunds are against their policy, they didn't even attempt to return half the money. Basically they got almost 300 out of me for a subscription I can't even use. I'm disgusted and I feel cheated out of my money, I regret ever using this companies service. This is poor customer service with this type of solution and communication. "

They were able to do whatever I asked them to do.

MageNatives team has worked with us repeatedly to improve our apps and always respond to requests and queries no matter how small. Couldn't ask for better support from third parties we agree to work with. The apps work well and support is everpresent. Keep up the good work.

23,MegaNative,Monumental Ltd,4/5 stars,"April 9, 2021","Brilliant service so far. You can customise your app very freely, upload your own graphics and link those graphics to your products. It syncs with your shop so when you're designing the app, all of your collections and products can be linked to which I think is perfect. You should be aware that in order to have an app, you need to have a Developer Account so you will need to pay for that separately. You have to pay Apple yearly for this. But if your shop does well, you should make that money back each year. The only thing I think I would prefer with MageNative is being able to send more push notifications each month. As an app, you don't want to send too many notifications because you might annoy your customers, of course. But on a basic plan with MageNative, you only get 3 push notifications a month. This technically would limit you to only being able to send a push notification to your customers every 10 days. You have to upgrade to a higher plan if you want more push notifications. Other than that, I am very happy with the service MageNative provided. They have helped every step of the way and always replied to my questions. They took control of the app and handled everything that I didn't know how to do. We are now waiting for Apple to approve the app which only takes 48 hours. Thank you MageNative for a positive experience! "

77,MegaNative,M*A*D*E* I*N*C*,5/5 stars,"December 14, 2020","I’m happy to be back on the Magenative app platform. I’ve used them in the past and was disappointed in the slow response time (I must say has improved GREATLY) and that caused me to switch platforms. The platform I switched to looked good but they lack some important features such as scheduling post and it would always freeze up not to mention some links didn’t work. So I figured I’ll go back and try the Magenative platform again and to my surprise the response time has improved as I stated before, but I was even more impressed/excited to see there was completely new and redesigned panel which works even smoother than before and has a cleaner interface. Oh yeah I almost forgot about the option of integration features they have incorporated. They also have some of the best pricing. "

90,MegaNative,Elite LUX Store,5/5 stars,"November 23, 2020","Working with MageNative team and especially Aneesha who was point developer on our iOS app has been such a pleasure and amazing experience. We had so many additional requirements, design changes, and the team at MageNative was more than happy to accommodate all our requests without showing any type of push back. We have managed to build a completely custom iOS app specifically tailored to the requirements of our online business, with so many additional features and integrations where Aneesha from MageNative has accepted with open mind all requirements and always figured out a solution for our asks regardless on how challenging the requirement was. We have had also so many last minute requests and changes and additional features, that the team was very happy to tackle for us, and for any bug we found during intensive testing, the team at MageNative rushed to get it resolved in a timely manner. I would also like to highlight the astounding efforts Aneesha has placed on our iOS project to the extent that she would reply over weekends, and late nights working together on the iOS app to respect our deadline for holiday season release. Truly, as much as I write in this review, I can't express enough what a joy and ease it was working with MageNative and especially Aneesha in releasing our iOS app. Thank you so much team for this amazing partnership, and looking forward to updating this review further with more information on our Android release very soon."

115,MegaNative,BottleKeep,4/5 stars,"October 20, 2020",Easy & straight forward service from them. Team is always there to assist. I believe the area they can improve is to ensure they run the API thoroughly before sending the finish product to avoid time wasting. But this is App development so there's bound to be bugs etc.

When i had a question someone from the engineering team was quick to respond, even with the time zone difference. Great service!! Wish they had an affiliate program!"
121,MegaNative,EnaxMart,1/5 stars,"September 26, 2020","It was big mistake to go with them. Our business heavily suffered due to the poorly developed app(bugs, crashes,etc). I somehow think that as a strategy they have kept the monthly subscription low and they share a mediocre app reference in the beginning and ask clients for some customizations charges. Once the client has paid through time and money to improve the app, it becomes hard to switch. Seems like a perfect bait. Unfortunately, we discovered it too late. To add, there is no quality control, no one managing the service. You would be left to some developer who is in a different world and does not give a hoot about your business. Just a heads up for people considering to use this app. "
122,MegaNative,Harks.in,5/5 stars,"September 16, 2020",A great company to have your needs fulfilled on time. Magenative team is a good and supportive team in terms of their customer service. Dedicated support from magenative is a great factor that makes a difference. Give it a try...

125,MegaNative,Common Sense Coffee,5/5 stars,"September 11, 2020","The MageNative Team is fantastic! They got our apps on the app stores quickly and they both look incredible. The team is extremely approachable and provides support via email and WhatsApp. It's so easy working with them. They also do great work too. Just search ""Common Sense Coffee"" on either the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store to see their quality. I highly recommend working with them and will continue to work with them in the future on different projects. Thanks, MageNative!"
126,MegaNative,Brooke and Raine Boutique,5/5 stars,"September 7, 2020",It is seamless and perfect. The developers listen to my needs and allowed me to make several changes throughout the process.

127,MegaNative,Fancy Plants,5/5 stars,"September 3, 2020","This is a great app builder for android/iOS! Really simple to get started. There are added costs to sign up to Apple and Play Store unless you already have an account. MageNative made several customisations for me to make it meet my needs at no trouble whatsoever. They also published my app. Contact over WhatsApp was easy. Highly recommend - everything links through to Shopify automatically. I also love the Wishlist function, and that I can send push notifications out."

129,MegaNative,Zipply,5/5 stars,"August 29, 2020","We were looking for a quick solution to get our shopify store translated to the app store/google play, and Magenative did an exceptional job, especially on the iOS side. The developer who led that front, Aneesha, did a phenomenal job and listened to all our requirements. We still can't believe we're live on the app store in less than 45 days. It's impossible to do that when you're building a custom app - but Magenative really knows shopify and I can guarantee this is quickest way to get to the app store. Don't hesitate, get working with them!"
130,MegaNative,Lilly and Rose Boutique,5/5 stars,"August 28, 2020",We are on our last few tweaks to the App before going LIVE and so far the customer service and promptness has been wonderful.

138,MegaNative,Nuve by EcoPod,1/5 stars,"August 11, 2020","Magenative is the biggest scam I have ever heard of. I have no idea how they are listed on Shopify's app store. I spent weeks waiting on them to fix my app for my Shopify store. It was a nightmare. They put you into a sketchy group conversation and ""Developers"" work on your app, but I had to beg them to make any changes. The layout is messy for the app. Do not even bother wasting your time or money with these people. I wasted so much energy into trying to get them to fix the app for me. They even asked me to pay $200 outside of Shopify through paypal in order to fix the app the way I wanted it. So terrible. I hope they get removed from Shopify. "
139,MegaNative,Myztified Giftz,5/5 stars,"August 11, 2020",I used the app to help build my Giftware/Gift Shop App to allow my customers access on the go. Staff from both Android and IOS have been very helpful and communication is on point.

147,MegaNative,Old Country Jerky,5/5 stars,"July 9, 2020","I used MegeNative to implement a mobile app for quick and easy online shopping experience for our existing customer. For me, It is the most cost effective way Instead of hiring a company to design one and it would cost at least 7 grands. Although there were some hiccups in the process, but MageNative Team was great and quick in solving those problems. Now, it works like a charm, I feel rewarding every time I see a customer placing an order using the app. Highly recommended for all small business owners. "

Customers are writing me left and right that the app keeps crashing on them on Iphone and Ipad.  Not getting any support.   I paid them for one year.  Nobody is around to respond to me while I'm awake.  I get a whatsapp message at 3 AM when I can't respond because well, I need to sleep at some point.  I reached out to them with a push notification issue letting them know that they weren't working for everyone and they tested one and it worked for them so they told me it was fine.  It definitely was not fine.  I get about 1 out of 5 I send.  "

170,MegaNative,Rob Kaz Art Shop,2/5 stars,"May 2, 2020","I chose the option to ""chat with an expert"" because the app wouldn't display my menu. Without a menu, the app is useless. They said to reply with email and ask for modifications (for which they would no doubt charge a fee). Why have an option to chat with an expert if they refer you to email? Why have an app without a store menu? Very disappointed in the customer service. Moving on to another company to help launch my app."

They cannot integrate Facebook SDK with events and ask for admin password of your FB account. Serious number of bugs, sorting issues in products, absolutely ZERO testing before they publish the app. Lost money because of their inefficiency. Only 1 basic buggy layout. Any design changes, they will ask for money. If you are serious about your business and brand, stay away!"

291,MegaNative,Who's Your Dado,5/5 stars,"January 3, 2019","Great experience with MageNative team! Even tho during holidays they were responsive and answered all my questions, adjust anything I asked them to. App is working well no complains, support is 5/5 as they’re in the what’s app group with you and another 7-8 team members ready to respond at any moment. I’d definitely recommend it for all of you who are not able to afford native app build from scratch by order, as this will cost you waaaayyy less! It’s great to be present in your costumers pockets and phones, go get it and best of luck, make some through the roof sales! All the best! "
