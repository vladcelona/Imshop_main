0,GREATS,5/5 stars,"May 25, 2021","Firstly, the Plobal team has been incredibly attentive and was thorough with the process of getting to launch. Since developing our branded app, we have seen great performance. Special shout out to Sidd who has been working closely with us and making sure we kept the momentum going with app retention."
1,NRML,5/5 stars,"May 18, 2021",Moved over from another platform similar to Plobal. Plobal listened to my mission with our application as well as resolved existing problems we had with our previous developer. They worked hard to adhere to our needs to make sure our application was exactly what we imagined. From the follow-up calls to the call-outs we didn't even ask for - if you want to work with an application who cares and really wants to make your business suceed - these are your guys. 5 star all around the board

3,Premier,5/5 stars,"April 22, 2021","Highly recommended. Bharath, Yuvi and the development team have been very helpful, responsive and have been able to make customizations for our needs."

It made our journey very easy to create our app and get all the features that we have on our website.A big thank you for Nikhat who has helped us with the setup, install campaigns and was very supportive in each customization needed and added it quickly with the technical team."
7,Wild Bohemian,5/5 stars,"March 13, 2021","Plobal has been awesome! So easy to use, the support team is amazing and they fix any issues very quickly. We've been so happy with them!"
8,The Pig E Bank app,5/5 stars,"March 5, 2021",I've seen all the competitors and Plobal is by far the best to me ! Customer service is awesome! Plus all the options!
9,Quality Approach Ltd,5/5 stars,"March 5, 2021","Plobal has been instrumental in the development and launch of our new app. Barath and his team have been very positive, working closely with us and responding quickly when needed."
10,Grand Cru Vinhos,5/5 stars,"February 23, 2021",It is easy to operate and we have a good support of the plobal team. It was quick to launch our MVP.

12,Mark Bell Sling Shot®,5/5 stars,"February 23, 2021",Plobal has been a great interface for us to use to help manage our mobile app! It has been great working with their team and using Plobal!
13,Reveille Trading Company,5/5 stars,"February 9, 2021","The app works well, and that's great, but the real reason that I am such a fan of Plobal is because of their customer service. Often we can find an app or service that can do what we want most of the time but finding a good team of people is rare. I have been working with these guys for a few months now, and they are just as attentive to me now as they were the day we signed up. I highly recommend Plobal."
14,PetsOffice,5/5 stars,"January 21, 2021","It's a great App, very easy to use and the team is very friendly. Especially Sumant, was very supportive and was the reason for me to register on Plobal Apps !"

16,Eshopifiz,3/5 stars,"December 12, 2020","Good App but lost stars as most businesses are startups and very new and the prices are so expensive for small businesses - we just cannot afford $249 - $699USD per month, just rediculous so I have decided to delete. I like the app, it takes time to set up and add all your items manually but once set up you cant preview until you buy a plan so lost stars for that, honestly, if I cannot see my preview before I buy then it's not worth looking into for a future purchase. Maybe in the near future, I might look into this if it was at least half the prices that is advertised."
17,Galenika Cosmetics,5/5 stars,"December 11, 2020","Thank you very much Mr. Sidd, amazing how you and your team work. Congrats!This app help us to reach new customers and retain them. Guillermo Rodríguez (Pharmacist, CEO & Founder of Galenika Cosmetics)"
18,Perfume Philippines,5/5 stars,"December 3, 2020",The Plobal App was easy to set up and it turned out great. It automatically syncs up with our Shopify store and now our mobile users have a much better platform for shopping on our site. The Plobal Apps customer service is excellent and the best I’ve ever experienced. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is working properly. They responded within a few hours to any concerns we had and quickly resolved any issues. I highly recommend Plobal Apps!
19,Revel Nail,5/5 stars,"December 2, 2020","When we were on BigCommerce we paid an outside company $25,000 to develop an app and paid a monthly fee based on the number of orders. When we switched to Shopify we were planning on paying for a new custom app and were only going to use Plobal as a temporary solution. One of our employees in marketing who is not a programmer set up our app in a few days and had it going with no developer assistance. The app is better looking and more functional than the one we paid thousands of dollars for and we'll be sticking with Plobal. Neil and Rohit and the team offer excellent support. We do hundreds to thousands of orders a day on sales days and the app has absolutely no problems with it. If you are looking for a scaleable, beautiful, but easy to set up app, this is the solution for you."
20,ShopSM,5/5 stars,"December 2, 2020",Plobal is the best choice to quickly launch your shopify store's mobile app. Great support from the Plobal team in helping us build the app until our launch. 
21,Art Pointe,5/5 stars,"November 27, 2020","All I have to say is wow. Between the extremely kind, outgoing, hilarious and joyful group you get to work with, they are there to help you through every step of the way, have extremely user friendly and simplified guides on all of processes from A-Z. You can be as involved or not as you’d like for your app creation, and if you chose to play a large role in designing, they will fully support you and help with suggestions to make your app reflect exactly how you want your business to be seen. There are not enough words to express how highly I recommend Plobal; they are always as invested, if not more, in your business being successful as you are. "
22,inavase Flower Concept,5/5 stars,"November 2, 2020",Great sales service from Sumant. Convinced us to sign up and go with Plobal. Looking forward to launching our apps with Plobal.
23,Andre Badi,5/5 stars,"November 2, 2020","This app works seamlessly. I have been searching for a way to convert my Shopify store into an app without duplicating information or custom developing.

They helped out in every way in terms of making it possible and in terms of customizations that we required. Plobal apps offer great attention to detail and support and have been striving to make the application successful. Always a good addition to a website. I would recommend using their services as I'm sure to be using them again on any future online stores we work on. 
67,Sri Sri Tattva,5/5 stars,"March 10, 2020",The team has been very efficient in helping out on most of the possibilities and customisations that were required set up the app. The app is smooth and easy to operate. Basic layout customisations are really good to make immediate changes live. There are few more features that I required which are not part of the app but the team is willing to look into it and put efforts working it out. All in all I couldn't find any other better Shopify app that can be integrated quickly with good features as Plobal. I suppose if you're on Shopify except Plobal the next option is only to build a custom native app if you require something more than what Plobal has to offer.

72,2071MALL,5/5 stars,"November 21, 2019","We used this app to launch our store mobile app. They were quick in explaining the process and time frame needed for it. Easy to contact the service desk and they are ready to help all the time. Proper guidance was provided in creating google and apple developer account. They have certain packs and it's a bit expensive for startups, I wish in future they work on the pricing. Apart from pricing, Plobal is one of the best to go with Shopify. "

77,FuturXwear,1/5 stars,"January 24, 2020","NEVER enter into plans with them, and NEVER INSTALL this app, because when you just subscribe to a plan, you can't just uninstall the app and future billing are cancelled, NO NO NO, you will pay every month even if you don't have this App on your apps and Sales Chanel.

93,theorangeroom,3/5 stars,"August 1, 2019","It seems to have ok features. The preview is buggy. The pricing is exorbitant for what it offers. The minuscule space allocated for the logo is silly (mobile version of basic Shopify ""Debut"" theme does this better) Also pretty strange that push notifications are not even included in the base package when Plobal aren't even the ones providing the service (you have to connect to PushOwl, which you have to pay for anyway). "

110,Angeles Wear Limited,1/5 stars,"May 17, 2019","The team behind this app are excellent in very poor communication. I can't see a demo version of what I will be paying for yet they are interested to choose a plan first. When you give a free trial, allow customer to paly around to understand your app and feel safe and comfortable but you are not allowing that, well according to my experience with you. I need to unistall this app, not worth my time and money.  Y"

115,VirVia,3/5 stars,"April 25, 2019","People are nice but the free app is not easy to install .. Wastage of time and energy. I think Shopify should not recommend such channels which are not of any use, particularly when the free things are promised.. Nothing is free in this world  Lets be transparent in business  "

I am SO EXCITED I stumbled upon plobal apps because I was about to install tapcart and from the get to it was a nightmare so I imeediately discountinued and went with plobal. OH!

176,Top Gadgets Shop,5/5 stars,"August 1, 2018","If you are looking to open up your marketing channel and not be restricted to just Facebook Pages and Google Adwords and wish to utilize the mobile apps platform, then this is the app to choose. What I like about this service provider is the 24 hour follow up service and the automation provided by the app. At the end of the day, you will still need to employ various marketing services to boost your app downloads, but not creating an app for your e-commerce store is simply foolish and if you have no coding skills like me, then I suggest you take a look at this service provider. There are still some improvements needed, such as currency conversion but their management is definitely working on it. Anyway, if you want to take advantage of the mobile apps platform (iOS/Android), download this app and experience it yourself. You can literally submit your app within 10 minutes."
177,Beauty Reborn Technology,5/5 stars,"August 1, 2018","Definitely the best or if not, one of the best service providers I have used so far. I have had experiences in creating apps in the past with freelancers but the Plobal App definitely lets any one without coding experience to create their native shopping app with ease.

I found it quite easy to design my app to look the way I wanted. I love that Plobal has an additional app for the designer to preview on your mobile phone to see how it's looking! That's very helpful in visualizing the end result. Yuvraj has also helped me step by step figure out what needs to be done with google & apple so that my app can go live!

I love all of the features, sorting capabilities, subcategories and everything it offers. Price was important to me as well and their pricing was very reasonable.

245,Tiamat Coin Exchange,5/5 stars,"February 19, 2018","Really nice app. It mirrors my shopify rather well. Not all aspects of it mind you, for instance, if you put up a banner in your shop, the app will not pick it up.  But it does gather the collections and other setups that i needed. The customized aspect on the admin end is minimal. The analytics is a big plus. When you open the app, doves dont fly out and there is no parade. It's just a simple app to help me sell my wares. And thats all i needed.  And the staff are very nice and a pleasure to work with.  I was hesitant about a few things and Yuvraj Kewate help me out with the questions, I wasn't feeling the price but Ali Motiwalla gave me a decent discount. and when it came time for the back end system checks and launching,  Rutuja Thackeray and her team made my day. She made a smooth launch possible even when i was having problems, excellent communication and always ready to help.  I will be working with Plobal apps for a long time to come.  "

294,Fidget Spinner Toys Central,5/5 stars,"November 14, 2017","The cost of hiring a developer to create an Android and iOS Apple app for a website usually costs a fortune. Plobal helps Shopify site owners create a working, functional app for both app platforms for zero up-front cost, and they only charge a fee after your apps generate revenue, which is very fair and generous. You can customize your apps to a certain degree and you have to pay Google and Apple their fees (each $99 or less) to publish and simply having the apps listed on your website boosts your credibility and helps new sites generate money. They also provide generous time via Skype calls with useful tips on marketing your website and apps, at no extra cost and with no sales pushiness. They've helped hundreds of websites with apps, so they know their stuff. If you are expecting a fully customized Amazon style app for free, then you're being unrealistic. These apps are nice looking and allow customers to buy products in a clean, simple Google-like basic look with some colors and logo branding which, honestly most customers today prefer over very heavy apps. Plus you can have in-app pop up messages and send push notifications and do a lot of marketing at no extra cost. I HIGHLY recommend working with the Plobal Apps team, as there is no cost until you start making money via the app. You will learn a lot, build your site's credibility and make money along the way. At a minimum, it's worth giving it a shot, and if it's not for you, then at least you tried. Oh and, no reason to leave these folks a bad review and hurt their business. They were on the phone with me past 8pm at night working with me and others and they are solid at what they do. Just because it's not what you need, does not negate their value. Cheers!"
295,Bsparkle,5/5 stars,"November 11, 2017",Great experience so far. Android app is up and running and iOS will be up soon. Plobal team gave me some tips for improving the business and walked me down step by step in order to configure the app.
296,Bluestreak Crystals,5/5 stars,"November 10, 2017","Been using this app for about 6 months now and I am very happy with the mobile app and my customers also appear to be happy.

304,I Am Natural Shopify Trial,5/5 stars,"October 9, 2017","If you are looking for a cheap out-of-the-box mobile app solution, this one is by far the best. We started with a different app, but found its limited features, iOS only option, and non SDK function just didn't make having an app worthwhile. In fact, we just got negative feedback from app users saying ""why bother?"" And while i would be nice to afford a custom purpose-built app, we couldn't justify the spend."
305,Spree Spot,1/5 stars,"October 8, 2017",Every single positive review on here is fake. We were prompted to customize our app and then wait 24-48 hours for them to make the app and then after 4 days we contacted them and they told us we needed to customize our app which we already did. Do not waste your time. I have went through every app maker in Shopify and have not found one decent app maker. Better searching online to make a professional app.
306,Rustic Charm Interiors 2,5/5 stars,"September 19, 2017","Great product, great service, well worth the monthly fees. I highly recommend them. Far much cheaper that having a designer customise you website for mobile."

If we have any issues they are only ever an email away and respond very quickly to any questions.  We have had over 1600 app downloads so far and have generated a 1300% ROI so I would have to say it has been an outstanding success.  You get what you pay for and this app is worth the investment.
314,Chases Snack Emporium,5/5 stars,"July 10, 2017","I have tried literally all other Shopify mobile app builders, tailoring each app to its best ability and using the various preview apps to see what would be best.  On the surface, Plobal is quite expensive compared to competitors, however, after developing an iOS app with a different, free, service and then transitioning to Plobal I wish I would have just done it right off the bat."

What we like the most is that they are willing to work with you and they have the right attitude towards customers. They are not the most flexible app YET but they have built a very good foundation which works very nicely. Also, they are hard at work adding more customization capabilities and more features...You also get a lot of help along the way to set it up. We are just getting started and are super happy so far! Highly recommend it. "
338,Vapel1fe,1/5 stars,"December 21, 2016",So here we go.  I went to these guys because they emailed me asking to give them a second chance essentially.  Well I get a response from them about USING the SDK for 199 and they tell me that I cant use the sales channel Mobile.  WHY is no one using SDK if they are telling people they are.  Seems NO mobile platforum is supporting SHOPIFY non api SDK option.  Sad really.

346,Sfgopher,5/5 stars,"November 22, 2016","Plobal Apps.  Where do I start?  First off, I don't normally write reviews, but in this case, I had to.  Plobal Apps has one of the most user friendly and easy to navigate set ups I've seen and I've tried them all....There is no bait and switch as seems to be a trend with some Shopify Apps lately.  Just a solid, awesome platform to build a  quality app on.  I can't even begin to explain how phenomenal the customer service is....

352,Christopher Bean Coffee Company,5/5 stars,"November 14, 2016","I gave this a 5 because of the stellar customer support i received from the app team.  Between phone calls and emails i was never disappointed.  The other reason i gave this 5 was the app itself, now in saying that you have to compare apples to apples, this is an out of the box app, so you will have limitations with customization, but for ease of use, set up and functionality its great.  Did i mention customer support? The other reason i like this app is the team seems to be very intent on increasing the functionality of the app, so i would think that in the future you will see the ability to customize and even incorporate the app with other apps.

368,Island Haze,5/5 stars,"July 16, 2016","We researched a lot of other app developers before deciding to go with Plobal Apps. After reading countless number of reviews, the #1 problem most people complained about was the lack of communication with the other companies. Not with Ali and his team at Plobal Apps though. Like the other reviews have already stated, Plobal Apps do an excellent job at communicating and will often get back to you within hours, if not sooner. The dashboard is very straightforward and easy to use, and integrates very well with the Shopify platform. The best thing about them though is they are constantly looking at ways to improve the app, to ultimately create a better user experience for both us, their clients, and the end user, our customers. Keep up the good work!"
369,Itsablackthang,5/5 stars,"July 12, 2016",The Plobal App was easy to set up and it turned out great.
