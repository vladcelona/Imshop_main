0,MegaNative,Magroceries,https://magroceries.com/,5/5 stars,"June 16, 2021","I have tried out 10+ different apps and none of them were able to help me they way this one did. Through the great help from the developers I was able to customise a currency conversion option that is essential to my business. When there is a problem, customer support will have it fixed for you before you even know it. This is app you want to use if you want your own shopping app! Also, it is far cheaper that most others and gives much more value that the once that are able to offer an even lower price. This the the best cost/benefit you will find! "

I was unable to use this app and paid for a 6 months subscription apparently my business isn't allowed to be in the IOS or Android platforms, after informing the company their solution was for me to add these long instructions on my website for customers to download the app. Literally the steps we have to take to get the app on our phones as if any customer would take that much time out of their day to add an app. After a month of waiting for a response refunds are against their policy, they didn't even attempt to return half the money. Basically they got almost 300 out of me for a subscription I can't even use. I'm disgusted and I feel cheated out of my money, I regret ever using this companies service. This is poor customer service with this type of solution and communication. "

22,MegaNative,Monumental Ltd,http://www.lethbridgemonumental.com/,4/5 stars,"April 9, 2021","Brilliant service so far. You can customise your app very freely, upload your own graphics and link those graphics to your products. It syncs with your shop so when you're designing the app, all of your collections and products can be linked to which I think is perfect. You should be aware that in order to have an app, you need to have a Developer Account so you will need to pay for that separately. You have to pay Apple yearly for this. But if your shop does well, you should make that money back each year. The only thing I think I would prefer with MageNative is being able to send more push notifications each month. As an app, you don't want to send too many notifications because you might annoy your customers, of course. But on a basic plan with MageNative, you only get 3 push notifications a month. This technically would limit you to only being able to send a push notification to your customers every 10 days. You have to upgrade to a higher plan if you want more push notifications. Other than that, I am very happy with the service MageNative provided. They have helped every step of the way and always replied to my questions. They took control of the app and handled everything that I didn't know how to do. We are now waiting for Apple to approve the app which only takes 48 hours. Thank you MageNative for a positive experience! "

I’ve used them in the past and was disappointed in the slow response time (I must say has improved GREATLY) and that caused me to switch platforms. The platform I switched to looked good but they lack some important features such as scheduling post and it would always freeze up not to mention some links didn’t work. So I figured I’ll go back and try the Magenative platform again and to my surprise the response time has improved as I stated before, but I was even more impressed/excited to see there was completely new and redesigned panel which works even smoother than before and has a cleaner interface. Oh yeah I almost forgot about the option of integration features they have incorporated. They also have some of the best pricing. "

The layout is quite basic, but the (friendly) customer support helps you to customise it. For basic updates, they don't ask any charge. They could be just a bit more organised and assign you a single point of contact (all the communications are on WhatsApp), but their service works fine, and I am happy to use it. "

We had so many additional requirements, design changes, and the team at MageNative was more than happy to accommodate all our requests without showing any type of push back. We have managed to build a completely custom iOS app specifically tailored to the requirements of our online business, with so many additional features and integrations where Aneesha from MageNative has accepted with open mind all requirements and always figured out a solution for our asks regardless on how challenging the requirement was. We have had also so many last minute requests and changes and additional features, that the team was very happy to tackle for us, and for any bug we found during intensive testing, the team at MageNative rushed to get it resolved in a timely manner. I would also like to highlight the astounding efforts Aneesha has placed on our iOS project to the extent that she would reply over weekends, and late nights working together on the iOS app to respect our deadline for holiday season release. Truly, as much as I write in this review, I can't express enough what a joy and ease it was working with MageNative and especially Aneesha in releasing our iOS app. Thank you so much team for this amazing partnership, and looking forward to updating this review further with more information on our Android release very soon."

120,MegaNative,EnaxMart,https://www.facebook.com/EnaxMart/,1/5 stars,"September 26, 2020","It was big mistake to go with them. Our business heavily suffered due to the poorly developed app(bugs, crashes,etc). I somehow think that as a strategy they have kept the monthly subscription low and they share a mediocre app reference in the beginning and ask clients for some customizations charges. Once the client has paid through time and money to improve the app, it becomes hard to switch. Seems like a perfect bait. Unfortunately, we discovered it too late. To add, there is no quality control, no one managing the service. You would be left to some developer who is in a different world and does not give a hoot about your business. Just a heads up for people considering to use this app. "

The developer who led that front, Aneesha, did a phenomenal job and listened to all our requirements. We still can't believe we're live on the app store in less than 45 days. It's impossible to do that when you're building a custom app - but Magenative really knows shopify and I can guarantee this is quickest way to get to the app store.

They put you into a sketchy group conversation and ""Developers"" work on your app, but I had to beg them to make any changes. The layout is messy for the app. Do not even bother wasting your time or money with these people. I wasted so much energy into trying to get them to fix the app for me. They even asked me to pay $200 outside of Shopify through paypal in order to fix the app the way I wanted it. So terrible. I hope they get removed from Shopify. "

Without a menu, the app is useless. They said to reply with email and ask for modifications (for which they would no doubt charge a fee). Why have an option to chat with an expert if they refer you to email? Why have an app without a store menu? Very disappointed in the customer service.

The developers are very slow in responding. They cannot integrate Facebook SDK with events and ask for admin password of your FB account. Serious number of bugs, sorting issues in products, absolutely ZERO testing before they publish the app. Lost money because of their inefficiency. Only 1 basic buggy layout.

414,Drobile,Peak Performance Nutraceutics,https://www.peaknutritionshop.com/,5/5 stars,"December 17, 2020","First off, anyone considering doing an app for their store definitely should. It's an investment but the data shows higher conversion rates, more touch points through the app, etc. Don't wait. Second, DROBILE IS THE BOMB. I've tried many apps, plugins, tools, etc, and these guys are by far the best and industry leaders. If you are thinking about Tapcart or any other mobile app, I've tried them all and you need to READ THIS. Drobile is not only less expensive, they have MORE features than tapcart and WAY BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE. I was browsing and found them, decided to call the number and the founder answered the phone. CRAZY. He not only answered all my questions, which I can be quite detailed lol, he spent over 30 minutes with me explaining everything and addressing any concern I had. Better yet, once I signed up and moved from Tapcart they walked me through everything, got things done super fast, and are CRAZY RESPONSIVE when it comes to customer service and questions. Their blocks of data are extremely easy to customize, they will do custom code for you if you are willing to pay for something specific that you need, AND they have a native LOYALTY PROGRAM. This is huge for getting the word out about your app and incentivizing purchases, shares, downloads, etc. I'm so happy with their product and service I'm even willing to answer any question from a customer perspective. You can email me below. And no, I'm not paid or compensated in any way shape or form, I just really appreciate great products and services like this and they made it easier to launch an app than I thought. ;) support@peaknutritionshop.com"

626,Vajro,Laceybird,https://laceybird.com/,3/5 stars,"May 20, 2021","We loved this app in the beginning. If you are looking to turn your webstore into an app this is great for your customers. However we chose this one specifically for its live selling feature. There were too many issues with it not being able to connect to FB and our customers often complained the app would freeze multiple times they would have to close the app completely and reopen it. (after so many times they wouldn't come back, which means we lose out on $$). There was also issues with the our rewards (smile) integration. Our customers couldn't see their points or redeem. Also checkout wasn't seemless. The checkout didn't accurately portray prices when discounts, free shipping, or local pickup was used. This caused a lot of confusion for our customers. Ultimately they would leave the app and head to our site. We understand that this is new but we can't afford to ride it out while they trouble shoot everything. Aside from that their customer service is AMAZING they get back to you quickly. The app is customizable to fit your theme and its easy to create. "

Lemme start by saying this, do not believe the positive reviews you are currently seeing on this app 'they beg you to put that after the first communication'' it's all lies. First they started talking to me so good about the options and so that I'll get when I start using their platform,Mind you I was only asking questions. The communication was on point, But guess what ? I was fooled by that. They only talk and give you the best support until you click confirmed and approved billing. After I did all the above then I really start seeing the true colors of these people. I'm not going to lie it's the worst! If you're Considering giving your website an App this platform is definitely not an option stay far from it. They said it's 2 months free but believe me by the time they done dragging you out to set up the app and publish it, it would be 3 months done, and If you don't believe me go ahead and waste your time and money. ** WORST EVER*** here i come tapcart <3"

1035,Vajro,Black & Mobile,https://www.blackandmobile.com/,2/5 stars,"March 14, 2020"," This app has a lot of potential to be one of the best on the app store. My sales have increase, but I have also had to refund over $35,000 worth of food. They promise that they integrate with other apps, but THEY NEVER WORK PROPERLY. It took over 6 months for them to try fixing an issue and they never did. Their Store pick-up and delivery by zapiet integration does not work and it has hurt my business and reputation severely.  The Tidio integration also does not work. Every time I ask what's going on, they tell me to wait 1-4 weeks. I have had to constantly reach out to them for updates. Again, this app has a lot of potential if it works properly, but as of now it does not meet all of my needs and it has caused me to lose too much money. "

Starter, medium or big business. They got you covered. I have got an amazing support from Shan, Steve, Mohammed and others. They never Disappointed me. They customised the app according to how I want it to look like while I am still in a Trial Period knowing I can uninstall anytime and leave their efforts to waste. Who would do that for you? I believe  A good business comes with best customer service. You can have the best Dashboard and designs and go nowhere with bad customer service.

I'm extremely happy with the app and functionality. Those who have expressed concern over the limited hours they keep, this is actually due to the fact that they are in another country so the hours they are at work are considerably different than for us in the U.S. That said, they worked consistently to create a final product that I was happy with.

I never find better quality support in any service up to now. I asked them 100's of changes in my app. Even i asked them some minor favors, which were not even included in their job. But they never said sorry or no to me. I also want to mentioned here, that all this support, designing and changes were done in the 25$ basic plan. But I'll  try to move from basic to  premium package as soon as i can even my app looks more then perfect, but i want to check that if i'm getting that much in basic plan then how much i'll get in premium. This is my first review ever because i never find any service or support that amazing over the internet in such a reasonable price. Thumbs up to the team and i hope you people will see much much more success in this service.Without any doubt i'll give5 out of 5 in support.5 out of 5 in designing.5 out of 5 in requirement gathering and execution5 out of  5 in time management.But support was amazingly quick & best support cover all other things."

I have been using the Vajro app platform/ mobile app for about 5 weeks now! I could not be happier! I reviewed A LOT of mobile app platforms that would connect with my shopify store, and I mean  alot. And after testing many, and meeting with several of the other mobile app companies via conference calls and demo's of their product, Vajro was the best one, by far. It has the most intuitive features, the most robust themes to choose from, and their customer service is AWESOME! I have mostly been working with Sherin & Niwin on the Vajaro team and both service reps have been incredible and helped me make changes on the fly when needed -- they are great!

Preview app saves a lot of time in understanding the look and feel of the app.9. Seemless app update - within seconds of you hit the ""publish"" you'll see the app interface update. - great of websites that have weekly offers or even daily updates!Con's (More like suggestions)1. Require deep link generation on the go (i.e. in the app)2. Font in the app - on some screens - can look hazy - a notch thicker font would do miracles.3. Need more collapsable menu's & the discount coupon 4. More integrations required - (bundle products, frequently bought together, upsells)5. Deeplinks for blogs required.6. Should be able to redirect within the app for blogs & news section.7. Simple contact us page or blank pages - a minimum of 1 per plan can help a lot.8. A way to edit the app in the mobile interface would be great. Summary - I would love to see the app grow with time & enable people like us to have an affordable alternative to creating an app in a jiffy! Thank you team Shopney!

1468,Shopney,King of Kuwait,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir_of_Kuwait,5/5 stars,"June 12, 2020","I did compare between all mobile app deveopers on shopify, Shopney is the best. you can see this by the features given to the gold plan and compare it to other apps. It gives you high and detailed customization. One example is the sub-sub-collections feature. I installed all availabe apps on shopify, none of them gives sub-sub-collection excepts one app that is too expensive to have this feature and its plan costs about $999! You'll save a lot, at the same time you'll have more features such as language where it is set based on your customer mobile language! this is amazing. Other things like the theme customization is the most exciting part for lot of people. The colors, the collections and the products appear based on the way you want it to appear. The Whatsapp, Instagram, and other social media account can be visible to your customers. The icons can be customized easily. Abandoned cart notifications. There is also a feature where you can upload your own icon for each single menu title. Everything inside is customizable. There is also messaging feature where your cusomters can contact you on the app. There are also some great integrations . Also for those who have print on demand business. You can add your products and let your cusomters design their own very easily. The product page and checkout is very advanced in terms of its looking. The publishing takes few steps and up to 5 days for your app to be published. This app should solve the features you want & the monthly billing. For entrepnuers who want to expand their business in a successful & profitable way, you'll not regret to give it a try!"

When i say ""requirements"" I'm referring to the app's build in function vs it's cost. Until a week ago i found shopney.It has a very simple builder which doesn't require any IT background, so anybody can build a nice mobile app easily. I have tested all the build in functions and realized the cost of the app is very reasonable. I had some issues with the push notification while testing the app, Murat and Melissa helped me through the whole process, and it works perfectly now.Here are some info for people who is considering shopney:1. The build in function already included ""wish list"", ""recently viewed"", personally I feel these 2 functions are very important to provide customers a better experience when they are shopping using the mobile app.2. ""My Account"" function is fully build, it allows the customers to check their orders, change the profile as well as address book within the app (some other mobile apps doesn't provide this function, or only have part of this function)3. The support team is always there, if you have any questions or difficulties like me, just contact them and they will get back very soon. In conclusion, this is the app that really worth the cost. :) Good work!"

They made the integration process of our brand new app ABSOLUTELY SEAMLESS and provided me with amazing specialists and account managers to make this the most comfortable project/app launch for us. Megan was incredibly attentive to granular detail and had an amazing level of communication that helped our company maintain confidence and happiness in the launch process. She was incredibly patient with the obstacles we encountered and managed to help us resolve all of them. Bobby, our account manager who left nothing out and covered all the granular details that most people would have left out and gave us tips on not only how to create and maintain our app but market it towards our target audience. They have left us beaming and incredibly happy with their services and I definitely recommend to anyone looking to transform the mobile optimization of their store by working with a team that cares and works incredibly hard for their clients. I predict this company to be a massive disruptor in the Mar-tech space and it's essential to jump on board before your competitors. Do give them a try and go with the Enterprise plan, you will not be disappointed!! 5/5"

The whole onboarding and set-up process is a breeze and they are there for you through every step of the way. I am amazed at how successful we have been with our app after just 3 months. We already have 18k downloads and it has brought in over 10% of our sales YTD. Updating the app is super super easy and our CSM, Kenyon, is always there to help with anything we need. He is quick to respond and we always figure out a solution if any problems arise. I can talk so highly about TapCart every day. As technology is always changing, we have to stay innovative and change with it. A lot more consumers are shopping on their phone and offering an app with TapCart was truly game-changing.

1646,Tapcart,Bros with Hoes Plant Co,https://bwhplantco.com/,4/5 stars,"April 16, 2021","Truly a turn-key experience taking your website and turning it into a user-friendly app! While we absolutely love the app we have had some hiccups along the way pushing us to pay more than we anticipated to use this platform properly for our business. Our business does weekly product drops that we previously were able to schedule with our standard Shopify subscription. Once signed up for the app we realized that our Shopify plan didn't support product scheduling outside of the ""online"" sales channel so any new items we scheduled would immediately go live on Tapcart and could not post at our desired time. The only solution was to either scrap the app or upgrade to Shopify Plus (a $2k a month Shopify upgrade) in order to use Launchpad. Being able to schedule products accordingly is vital to our business so this upgrade would definitely not be necessary for most businesses. One other feature the app is lacking is a way to refresh without having to close out of it entirely. Our products sell out FAST, so this means our customers need to be able to have the items refresh to show real-time status of whether a product is in stock. Right now the item might sell out and will still state it's in stock while in the customer's cart. Our account manager did mention that this is a feature they're working on there's just no timeline of when it will be ready. The price points range pretty drastically but it makes the app pretty accessible for almost any business big or small. So far so good on our end! "
1647,Tapcart,Luckless Outfitters,https://www.lucklessclothing.com/,5/5 stars,"April 16, 2021",App performs great for us. Customer support is great as well as the ease-of use. Would recommend for any business.

1649,Tapcart,W Cosmetics,https://www.wcosmetics.com.au/,5/5 stars,"April 15, 2021","I have nothing but amazing things to say about Tapcart! The representatives that I interacted with through-out my process were Ryan, Nicolette, and Cole. First I would like to start off saying how fast and seamless the process was. I had a very tight time line and they helped me achieve my goal. Getting set up in the Apple and Google Play stores were extremely easy. Tapcart integrates with your website great! It's user friendly and updates in real time which I really enjoy and is essential to my business. Another thing that really stuck out to me was that in about 30 days after launch they follow up with you to talk strategies on how to maximize your growth using the app. Within the first two weeks of launching, I have already seen an increase in growth and customer retention. 10/10 would recommend."

1653,Tapcart,Halfsies Cookie Company LLC,https://halfsiescookiecompany.com/,2/5 stars,"March 23, 2021","I really like the app's concept and the design of the app. It's clean and easy to use from my end. They did a great job with designing it and getting it on the app stores. However, there is a serious lag when you update products or quantities (from sold out to in stock). There's no way to refresh the app (no long swipe down) so you have to force close and reopen which sometimes fixes the problem. If you go into the view collection area of the app and play with the sorting feature it will sometimes provide an accurate view of the site in certain sort (best selling, a-z, etc) selections but not in others. I've gone round and round with Tapcart about this and they always blame shopify cache/api. If you are a shop that doesn't sell out or change product collections frequently, tapcart will be just fine. It's not a good look for my company as it's already annoying customers and we aren't even selling as quickly as we usually do. I'm going to hang on to it for awhile and let tapcart try and fix the issue- I'll update accordingly. "

All that is missing is the complete Smile.io integration which I have been informed is being worked on and will come in the future. Once that is complete, I'd give this platform 10 stars if I could. Recommendation: Night mode would be awesome for customers who enjoy a dark screen on their phone. I also wonder if Conversion-Bear would ever get on board with TAPCART to integrate as well. That would completely change the game for app sales and the experience. "

1767,Tapcart,Lush Fashion Lounge,https://shop.lushfashionlounge.com/,5/5 stars,"July 26, 2019",I highly recommend this!  After using a different company for our app for a couple of years that left us feeling out dated with little to no customer service and updates I made the switch to Tapcart and it was extremely smooth and easy to switch! They are so quick to respond to any and all issues and the integration within Shopify makes it really easy to use! I love that there's an app to send push notifications from making this an easy asset to use on the go! I think my favorite part is the ability to send products and photos in notifications!

We have been using it for almost 6 months, and when we signed up, we were promised that we would be given a dedicated app manager, customizations would be made for us, and that an Android app would be released soon. Here we are months later and we have never received any contact from an app manager (though I've had the owners call me every time I email to point that out and promise that someone would reach out), our customizations haven't even be addressed, and an android app has never been mentioned since (which is very frustrating for customers). We paid extra to be on the Plus plan, which is NOT worth it. Overall, there were a lot of empty promises made, and communication has since stopped from Tapcart's end."

1857,Tapcart,Monochrome New York,https://www.etsy.com/market/monochrome_new_york,5/5 stars,"May 31, 2018","I've had nothing but the best experience with the Tapcart team, at first I was a little hesitant because of the price, but after looking at the ROI of having an app and the credibility you build as a brand I decided to take the plunge. It is as mentioned by the many reviewer you've seen. Support is very responsive and a certain level of customizability is available through communication directly with the team. The process of uploading app is also a breeze, I'm an app developer myself and I know the hassle of creating and uploading an app to the app store, somehow they've figure out a work flow that makes it seamless from your design dashboard to an actual app. It feels like Magic. Lastly I wanted to give kudos to the team for accommodating my request to put that final polish on the upload of the app to get it to perfection. I look forwards to using and seeing the new version that's coming soon, I'm glad I choose Tapcart over some of the very aggressive competitors."

If you're looking for an app that is being improved regularly and is not just an afterthought to the developer, this is your company.  It's only getting better!!!  Keep up the great work, guys.

It’s my first experience with an iOS App, and I cannot code apps at all so when I managed to build our app in like 10 min, I was so excited! I had some special requests and the staff at TapCart always responsed to me really quickly. I’m really excited to see how their service evolves in future. I love the fact that iOS prompts the app to open when browsing our store. We’ve even linked it to our AdWords campaigns - it looks so professional! A top quality app. So far we’ve had loads of customers order our app and even had sales through it - and we’ve only been live in the App Store for a few days. The support has been brilliant and it’s a must have for anyone who has ever considered having their own app but doesn’t know where to start. Well worth the monthly fee. Best app we have installed, ever! Thanks for much for the amazing product and support :) check out our app in our store https://www.evolution-slimming.com/pages/get-the-app"

1927,Tapcart,Fashion Life 3,https://en-gb.facebook.com/pages/Fashion-Life-3/261679517329536,5/5 stars,"August 30, 2017",The Tapcart team have been super efficient & helpful.  The setup process has been a breeze.  We are really excited about the potential of this app & what we can now offer our mobile customers!
1928,Tapcart,Luxury Life,https://www.instagram.com/luxxury__lifee/?hl=en,5/5 stars,"August 29, 2017","Best mobile app and service every! The team were able to cater our needs for localization, and tried their best to help us to launch the app in our own language. The UI was clean and nice, so is the admin site where you can set feature categories and such. We are very happy and satisfied!"
1929,Tapcart,Innovative Supplies,https://www.innovativesupplies.net/,4/5 stars,"August 26, 2017",I think this app is FAST and GOOD for anyone who is looking to step into the mobile app scene but does not know a lick of coding or is worried about the capital it would cost to invest in having someone build your app for you. There are a few hurdles you have to jump through but the staff walks you through each one step by step and monitor the chat room to answer questions you might have. I only rate it a 4 out of 5 because I think for the price of $99 it should come with little more features like the ability to add a background to your app or something cool. Very good App in summary. Invest the funds if you want a quality app. 
1930,Tapcart,Jess Lea Boutique,https://www.jessleaboutique.com/,5/5 stars,"August 24, 2017","The customer service is amazing!

1933,Tapcart,Five O Depot,https://thefiveodepot.com/,5/5 stars,"August 17, 2017","When we realized that no one in our industry had a mobile app, we started looking around for options to be a trailblazer. After kicking around and testing a few mobile app makers, we decided that they were too ""clunky"" and ""heavy""  for our use so we put the idea on hold for a while. Fortunately, we discovered Tapcart and started the process to build it. From day one, Sina and his team have responded to EVERY question, concern or recommendation we have had and it feels like we've known them forever. The back-end interface is easy to understand and use and everything is spelled out in layman's terms with no technical jargon. The front end is SMOOTH and customers are already telling us how easy it is to navigate through the app. So, ease of use for us, coupled with a pleasant end-user experience, has made Tapcart our app builder choice. So far, we ca't say say enough good about the experience. Here's to the future! "

1936,Tapcart,Collect And Display,https://collectanddisplay.com/,5/5 stars,"August 11, 2017","After spending several hours looking at the different options available that would allow me to create an app for my store I went with Tapcart, and I am so glad i did! Designing the app was a breeze and there are plenty of customisable features which allow me to make it my own. The support from the team was phenomenal, both very efficient and informative. My store was live in the Apple App store in just over one week! It is sleek and effective. There are cheaper options out there but none that are as effective as Tapcart, worth those extra $$. "

Thank you so so much!! "

The development team / customer service has been awesome to. I saw them doing update and test on Sunday, so you can tell they are doing everything to fix / add features on our request. More than everything I like that I don't have to manage a second store which was the issue with other mobile apps I tried in the past. Obviously, the products, the shipping rates, the collections pictures, what appears first, everything is based on your shopify setup.I'm excited to see the app develops and get the android version at some point.Keep up the good work!"
